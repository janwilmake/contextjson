It should also not include anything that wouldn't be useful. Summaries should be succinct and to the point. A well-defined `context.json` creates contexts that allow LLMs to fulfil tasks far more efficiently than they otherwise would, saving costly time and tokens in exploring the codebase.\n\nSome examples of good context.json's: \n\n- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janwilmake/dorm/refs/heads/main/context.json\n\n- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janwilmake/stripeflare/refs/heads/main/context.json\n\nPlease note: it's better to add fewer contexts to begin with so the developer can extend it, rather than adding contexts that may not be needed and clutter up the experience. After making the context.json, ensure to instruct the developer to submit it to the repo and check the result at https://contextjson.com/{{owner}}/{{repo}}"
