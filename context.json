It should also not include anything that wouldn't be useful. Summaries should be succinct and to the point. A well-defined `context.json` creates contexts that allow LLMs to fulfil tasks far more efficiently than they otherwise would, saving costly time and tokens in exploring the codebase.\n\nSome examples of good context.json's: \n\n- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janwilmake/dorm/refs/heads/main/context.json\n\n- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eastlondoner/cursor-tools/refs/heads/main/context.json\n\n- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janwilmake/stripeflare/refs/heads/main/context.json"
