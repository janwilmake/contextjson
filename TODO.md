# README

Create recommendations for creating the perfect `context.json`

# Ratelimit

Ensure the uuithub.com ratelimit isn't an issue, but also ensure it doesn't access my private repos!!!

# contextjson/index.html

Focus on the standard.

Tools:

- uithub shows context
- contextjson/owner/repo
- cli

# contextjson/owner/repo

- if context.json exists --> show ui for it,
- if not --> go to lmpify to prompt generating one for your repo but ensure all recommendations are in there

# contextjson/cli

cli & watcher to generate `.context` folder and token statistics based on `context.json` (and show that table in terminal)
